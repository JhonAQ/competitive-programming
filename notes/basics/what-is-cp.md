# Competitive Programming

The core of competitive programming is to solve a problem as fast as possible, and these are the two most important concepts: `solve` and `faster`.

To **solve** a problem is to find and code a solution for the problem, and it should be efficient in time and memory complexity.

**Faster** refers to the fact that all of the problems are known at the moment you solve them. In a contest, you shouldnâ€™t create or devise a complex solution (except for the ad hoc problems). Instead, all of the problems have a topic that solves them, and the challenge is to implement and solve it faster than other coders.

## So... why competitive programming? 

To be happy :)

- To be a master at the moment of code
- job interviews
- to be happy :)

## What if I cant solve a problem? 
Here are steps to solve a problem

### How to read problem sentences?
- read the problem statement thoroughly.
- Identify the key information, constraints and requeriments.
- Break the problem
- Pay attention to input-output limitations
- Analize the sample test cases and tru to understand the problem better.
- Check out the notes section of the problem statement. 
- Use pen and paper!!

### How to practice a problem efficiently? **Solve**
- firt the first, deeply understand what the problem asks you to do
- Try to solve it by yourself
- Always try to solve the problem using brute force, After that try to make your solution more efficient.
- so.. still you have no idea how to solve the problem? try to look at it from a whole new angle
- if the problem seems to have no solution.. read the then look up the editorial tutorial
- After solving a problem. by looking at the editorial/other's codes, and think about why your way of thinking was not correct, and what did you miss <--- ***Reallyyyy important***
- After that, find for solves of others better coders, and take their style code or useful scripts.
- if the problem uses a new idea/trick/algorithm, take notes of that

## Notas importantes

### La ley de Kidlin
Si puedes escribir algo de una forma sencillo, lo has dominado.
**No empieces a resolver algo que no entiendas del todo**

### Numero de problemas
No te obseciones con el numero de problemas resueltos. Esto no significa nada, pq la varianza es tan alta y es muy facil pasar mucho tiempo y resolver muchos problemas sin aprender nada.
**Los problemas son un medio!! no un fin!**

### Conseguir AC no es el objetivo final
Aprender algo nuevo es el objetivo final

### Siempre preguntate `por que?`
- Por que esta solucion no es correcta? 
- Por que esta solucion es correcta? 
- Por que esta solucion es optima? 
- Por que esta solucion no es optima? 
- Por que esta solucion me da un TLE? 
- Por que funciono? 
- Por que existimos?
