# Competitive Programming

The core of competitive programming is to solve a problem as fast as possible, and these are the two most important concepts: `solve` and `faster`.

To **solve** a problem is to find and code a solution for the problem, and it should be efficient in time and memory complexity.

**Faster** refers to the fact that all of the problems are known at the moment you solve them. In a contest, you shouldnâ€™t create or devise a complex solution (except for the ad hoc problems). Instead, all of the problems have a topic that solves them, and the challenge is to implement and solve it faster than other coders.
